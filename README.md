## 🔧 Configuration

### 🔍 Biome.js Configuration

Biome.js replaces ESLint and Prettier, offering formatting, linting, and organizing imports in one tool. Key configurations include:
- Custom rules for accessibility, correctness, and complexity
- Automatic import organization
- Custom formatting styles for JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS

Configuration file: [`biome.jsonc`](./biome.jsonc)

Run the formatter and linter:
```bash
pnpm format
pnpm lint
```

### 📡 Orval Configuration

Orval generates `react-query` clients from OpenAPI specs. It is set up to:
- Fetch the OpenAPI spec from a deployed URL
- Split the output into endpoints and schemas
- Enable mocking for local development
- Integrate with Biome.js for consistent formatting

API client generation script: [`scripts/generate-api.ts`](./scripts/generate-api.ts)

Run the script:
```bash
pnpm gen-api
```

### 🌍 Environment Variables

Environment variables are managed with `t3-oss/env-nextjs` for type safety. Update `src/env.ts` to define and validate variables.

### 📦 TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is fully configured with plugins for animations, typography, and custom scrollbars. Customize `tailwind.config.ts` to extend themes or add plugins.

### 🌐 Internationalization

Add languages in `src/i18n` and update `i18n.ts` to include new translations.
