## ðŸ”§ Configuration

This template comes pre-configured with ESLint, Prettier, and Husky to ensure your code remains clean and consistent. Here are a few highlights about the configurations:

- **ESLint**: Helps in identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the aim of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and integrates with most editors. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.
- **Husky**: Used to apply pre-commit hooks, allowing you to run scripts before committing.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Customize the `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc.js`, and `tailwind.config.ts` to suit your coding style and project requirements.
- Use the `public` directory to store static assets such as images, fonts, and `robots.txt`.
- Explore the Next.js [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more in-depth information about its features and API.

This README is designed to get you up and running quickly with a new Next.js project based on this template. For more detailed information about configuring and extending your project, please refer to the individual configuration files and their respective documentation.

Feel free to clone, fork, and adapt this template to fit your needs. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
